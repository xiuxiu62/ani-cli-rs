	<u>Anise</u>
</h1>

<p align="center">
	A terminal frontend to the gogoanime api.  This is a rust port of <a src="https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli">pystardust/ani-cli</a>, a bash script which targets mpv for locally streaming anime.  This is anise's strategy, additionally taking advantage of rust's robust ecosystem to provide a stable and verbose client experience.
