	<u>Anise</u>
</h1>

<p align="center">
	A terminal frontend to the popular gogoanime api.  This is a rust port of    <a src="https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli">pystardust/ani-cli</a>, a bash script which accomplishes the same goals and targets mpv for video streaming.  This is anise's strategy as well, aditionally taking advantage of the reobust rust ecosystem to provide a stable and verbose client runtime.

## Goals
- Deliver a clean extensible client application
- Provide safe and predicatable request parsing
- Watch anime

## Non-Goals
- Thin regex parsing of html documents
- A one to one client of ani-cli
- Don't watch anime
